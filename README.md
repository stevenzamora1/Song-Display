# Display Lyrics

**Display Lyrics** is a Python script that dynamically prints song lyrics with a typewriter effect, creating an engaging and animated reading experience.  

## Features
- Displays lyrics line by line with customizable delays for each character.
- Adds a fun and interactive way to experience song lyrics.
- Great for tiktok clips

## How It Works
The script uses Python's `sys.stdout.flush()` and `time.sleep()` functions to simulate a typewriter effect. Each character is printed with a small delay, and a longer pause separates each line.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
